CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY HUB PROPOSAL
A Strategic Investment in Student Success, Workforce Readiness, and Institutional Brand

THE OPPORTUNITY
By consolidating our creative technology programs—Graphic Design, Digital Media/Simulation & Game Development, and Computer Programming—into a unified Creative Technology Hub, we can deliver measurable value across multiple institutional priorities while preparing students for modern collaborative workplaces. We have the space, the programs, and the proven success to make this transformational.

WHY THIS MATTERS NOW
Our students are entering workplaces that look nothing like traditional classrooms. Creative agencies, tech companies, and design studios operate in open, collaborative environments where cross-functional teams work side-by-side. When students learn in environments that reflect professional practice—collaborative pods, shared makerspaces, flexible work zones, accessible faculty—they develop the soft skills employers demand alongside technical competencies.
While other institutions push more programming online, we’re creating the compelling answer to why in-person education delivers superior value. Students can watch tutorials anywhere. What they can’t get online is hands-on equipment access, spontaneous collaboration with peers across disciplines, immediate faculty guidance, and authentic preparation for collaborative professional environments. The Creative Technology Hub makes the case for why students should come to campus—because that’s where meaningful learning, professional preparation, and career connections happen.

WHAT WE’RE PROPOSING
Consolidate three programs into a single building through strategic furniture investment and space reconfiguration to create:
	∙	Collaborative classroom environments with pod-based layouts, presentation technology, and flexible configurations
	∙	Shared makerspace providing open-access production equipment (large format printing, vinyl cutting, 3D printing, garment printing) available outside of class hours
	∙	Modern lobby commons with modular furniture, integrated power, and mobile whiteboards as visible collaborative workspace
	∙	Faculty offices with visibility into student work areas, solving the office hours/classroom accessibility challenge
	∙	Cross-disciplinary project spaces where collaboration happens organically
This creates an ecosystem where the physical environment actively teaches professional workplace behaviors.

THE STRATEGIC VALUE
RECRUITMENT, ENROLLMENT & THE GRADUATE SHOWCASE SUCCESS
Our annual Graduate Showcase—a 42-year tradition—regularly attracts 125-175 attendees including prospective students, their families, and industry professionals. This past December, 90 area high school students participated alongside nearly 100 other attendees including employers actively recruiting our graduates.
This isn’t just student recruitment—it’s comprehensive industry engagement that demonstrates program quality to multiple audiences simultaneously. The Creative Technology Hub enables us to expand this proven success by bringing more programs into a unified showcase, attracting more diverse industry partners, and demonstrating the collaborative professional preparation that differentiates our programs.
If this investment helps recruit even 10-15 additional students annually, it generates $75,000+ in annual revenue—a 2-3 year payback period with ongoing enrollment value. This is highly photogenic content demonstrating why in-person education at our institution delivers value online programs cannot match.
WORKFORCE READINESS & INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS
Modern employers demand collaboration, communication, and adaptability. By learning in workspace environments that mirror industry practice, students develop these competencies authentically through daily experience. When employers visit for advisory board meetings, Graduate Showcase, or portfolio reviews, they see students working the way their teams work—building confidence in our graduates and strengthening regional workforce pipelines.
The Graduate Showcase has evolved into a premier industry connection event where employers consistently find qualified candidates. Program consolidation deepens these relationships and creates more placement opportunities across multiple career pathways.
ANSWERING “WHY IN-PERSON?” IN A DIGITAL AGE
What students cannot access online:
	∙	Hands-on professional equipment (large format printers, 3D printers, production tools)
	∙	Spontaneous cross-disciplinary collaboration
	∙	Immediate expert guidance and real-time feedback
	∙	Authentic workplace preparation (shared resources, professional critique, presentations)
	∙	Professional network building through events and peer relationships
The Creative Technology Hub creates undeniable value for choosing in-person education. It transforms “taking classes” into “working in a professional creative community”—our competitive advantage in an increasingly online landscape.
STUDENT SUCCESS & SPACE EFFICIENCY
Extended equipment access removes barriers to project completion. Faculty visibility improves accessibility. Cross-program collaboration builds community and expands professional networks. Students working in modern, well-equipped spaces that mirror professional environments perceive value and feel pride in their institution.
These programs are already curricularily integrated—SGD students take CP courses, UI/UX spans design and programming, successful GRD+CP capstones prove collaborative value. Consolidation eliminates equipment duplication, maximizes utilization of underused spaces, and solves longstanding operational challenges while creating new capabilities for event hosting and cross-program projects.
INSTITUTIONAL BRAND & COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
The Creative Technology Hub becomes a visible story of innovation. When prospective students, industry partners, legislators, or accreditors visit, they see institutional commitment to modern pedagogy and student-centered design. It generates ongoing marketing content and board reports.
While competitors move content online, we’re investing in compelling reasons students choose in-person education. This positions us as a leader in creative technology education and strengthens our reputation as an institution that invests in quality and innovation.

ALIGNMENT WITH STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
	∙	Communication, Collaboration, Presentation: Infrastructure explicitly designed to enable these capabilities
	∙	Visible Student Engagement: Active spaces that create the campus life attracting students
	∙	Workforce Development: Modern workplace preparation and industry partnerships
	∙	Enrollment Growth: 42-year Graduate Showcase track record with expansion potential
	∙	Space Efficiency: Eliminates duplication, maximizes ROI
	∙	Differentiation from Online: Creates irreplaceable in-person learning value

THE INVESTMENT & NEXT STEPS
Strategic furniture investment and space reconfiguration serving 13-15 full-time faculty and 300+ students across multiple programs. This infrastructure generates recruitment value, marketing content, industry partnerships, and operational efficiency with returns in enrollment growth, retention, employer satisfaction, and brand enhancement.
We seek leadership support to develop detailed implementation plans including space allocations, furniture specifications, budget parameters, and phased timelines. This requires coordination across departments and thoughtful solutions for existing space occupants, but the strategic value justifies the complexity.
We’re not asking for better classrooms. We’re proposing an investment in how we prepare students for modern careers while creating undeniable reasons to choose in-person education—a recruitment asset positioning this institution as innovative, workforce-focused, and student-centered.

While others move content online, we’re building the spaces and experiences that make in-person learning irreplaceable. The Creative Technology Hub is where learning, workforce development, and institutional brand converge into physical infrastructure serving students today while attracting tomorrow’s enrollments.
